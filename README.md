# Spring Boot testing playgorund

## Overview

This repository is intended to provide a sample Spring Boot project for those who wish to learn and practice implementing unit and integration tests. The main idea is to provide a “playground”, 
so that whoever makes use of this repository only focuses on implementing unit and integration tests without worrying about developing the functionality of the application. Explanations will be provided on the importance of testing, 
types of tests, as well as examples and proposed exercises to practice.
